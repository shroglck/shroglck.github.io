My research focuses on developing multimodal foundation models capable of complex temporal reasoning to build intelligent, general-purpose agents. I am interested in designing novel architectures and training strategies that enable models to understand, plan, and act in dynamic environments, with a particular emphasis on enhancing robustness, generalization, and corrective behavior.
